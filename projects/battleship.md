summary: Created a text based battleship game.
---



  For fun I created a text based version of battleship. The game was on a 5x5 grid with only three battleships with lengths of 3 spaces. The game could be played with either two players or one player against the computer. The computer was pretty easy to play against because it always choose spaces randomly even if it hit something. 

  Initially I thought it was going to be an easy project, but then quickly learned how much more complicated this was going to be. The biggest problem I had was making it so that when selecting ship placements you couldn't create overlapping ships. Another problem I ended up having was the AI sometimes shooting the same place making it even worse.

  It was a fun project though and gave me a very small glimpse into how complex making games could be.
